## Description of the tool

NBlockTester is a perl code (in proccess to be a cpan module) written by Aimer G. Diaz, with the supervision and comments of Clara Bermudez and Steve Hoffmann. It's an adaptation of the previously developed tool [blockbuster code](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/~david/LIFE/LIFE/blockbuster.html) @langenberger2009evidence, which detect blocks of overlapping reads using a gaussian-distribution approach. NBlockTester it's specially adapted for the detection of small ncRNAs fragments derived from longer ncRNAs like tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs, or even mRNAs @tuck2011rna, using mapped small RNA-seq data (bam files) and a set of genomic coordinates which would be used as a search space. The main purpose of the code is to discriminate small fragments (like tRFs -tRNA derived fragments-) who has a miRNA-like expression pattern from background-source expression (the tRNA source), recover in the small RNAseq protocol of sequencing which might be degradation or technical byproducts @gutierrez2018deteccion. 

## Installation 

By now just download this repository.

## Running with test data

To Run the code with a small test data set, please just run the shell file 

```
bash run.sh

```

Or alternatively directly launch the perl script: 

```
perl nBlock_tester_npv.pl test_data/Transcribed-non-protein-genes_regions/ncRNA-or-intergenic_regions.bed  test_data/Mapped_tag_reduced_data/12d4_S7.mapped.ncRNA.bam

```

## Dependencies 

The code it's also written to be run in parallel (fork), however it does requires the cpan module "Parallel::ForkManager". To install this module just run: 

```
cpan upgrade Test::More

cpan Parallel::ForkManager

```

Test installation by running 

```
perl -e 'use Parallel::ForkManager;'

```
